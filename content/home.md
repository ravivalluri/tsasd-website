# The Samoa Association San Diego

We are a Non Profit 501(c)(3) charity organization based in San Diego, California. Since its inaugural scholarship awards ceremony in July 2022, our organization has provided 8 scholarships worth $8,000 to hard working undergraduate recipients through our Scholarship Program. These are our future leaders in the community and the organizationâ€™s investment in their future success with the hope they will continue to carry the torch for their families and generations to come.
