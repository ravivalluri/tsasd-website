# The Samoa Association San Diego

We are a Non Profit 501(c)(3) charity organization based in San Diego, California. Since its inaugural scholarship awards ceremony in July 2022, our organization has provided 8 scholarships worth $8,000 to hard working undergraduate recipients through our Scholarship Program. These are our future leaders in the community and the organization’s investment in their future success with the hope they will continue to carry the torch for their families and generations to come.

Our mission is to promote and enhance understanding of the Samoan culture through educational activities and charitable projects
